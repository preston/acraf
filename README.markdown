## About

The *Aberration/Compound Response Annotation Format* (ACRAF) is an open XML format for the exchange of drug information as it relates to genetic variations, developed by the [http://cbi.tgen.org](Center for BioIntelligence) (CBI) at the [Translational Genomics Research Institute](http://tgen.org) (TGen). The supplied XML Schema Definition (.xsd file) and generated example files should give any developer familiar with XML generation and parsing a quick start towards working with the format. For those wishing to modify the specification, the original Oxygen project file is also included. ACRAF is free for others to use at modify under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).

If you would like to contribute to the project, please contact the author directly. ACRAF is not currently actively supported by TGen.
